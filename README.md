Introduction:

Description of my evolving research and changes: 


Change 1: [here](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02/commit/e988a63313929f7cbc1ec1fcda305aa3e536a342) Description: To fix an issue that I had with the original blog post is to change how quickly I moved into Drucker’s graph. In order to fix this, I created a better introduction to the image to allow the reader to better comprehend what I was trying to display.

Change 2: [here](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02/commit/a778e6e587cb17d99e430e18bae3e4e0d0d128b5) Description: The comment that Moretti’s graph needs more explanation as to how they are non-linear was fix by simply adjusting the paragraph and adding more explanation to my point.

Change 3: [here](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02/commit/2a63e808d7e977fbf58a29a5626189876dbf1934) Description: In addition to the changes under “Change 2” I built upon the comment that Moretti’s claims about progress as an oscillation or a pendulum might allow us to view those linear graphs in non-linear ways was fixed by expanding upon this point.
