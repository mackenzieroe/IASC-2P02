Finding New Ways to Compare

   Examination of Digital Humanities allows for a greater understanding of data analysis when it comes to graphs. Throughout comparing two different data elements, both space (A) and time (B) have no room for interpretation, thus this can create issues when it comes to analyzing the data with Digital Humanities insight. An issue that arises in digital humanities is the use of linear graphs as there is limited room for interpretation of variables. Multiple forms of data display would resolve the issue of having a  limited range of data to compare when trying to formulate a conclusion. Interpretation of GIFs, video files, topic models and other forms of digital graphs displaying more than two datasets, allows research of a wider range of data and leads to the possibility of infinite conclusions. 
    As Henri Bergson argues we conceive of time in spatial terms, Franco Moretti continues his argument as he examines graphs relating to the perspective of linear time as a concept that can be changed. Many ideas were examined by Franco Moretti as his graphs displayed the perspective of linear time as a concept that can be redesigned and ultimately affect the view of time in spatial terms. Moretti’s graphs allow for a new interpretation that time cannot be compared with the common linear format of left (being the past) to the right (being a future time) as a point A to point B comparison. This can be directly related to a quote from Drucker’s article Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display, “The point I’m making is that the basic categories of supposedly quantitative information, the fundamental parameters of chart production, are already interpreted expressions. But they do not present themselves as categories of interpretation...” (Drucker, J. 12. 2011). This quote demonstrates two forms of data that are being compared in a linear graph. Though the analysis of the graph Drucker investigates the idea of using more than two sets of data to allow for further knowledge. This allows the reader a broader interpretation; more than just A and B datasets, that are required in order to form a proper comparison. Drucker and Moretti’s articles, examine a new way of viewing graphs and explore variables in space (A) and time (B) for a wider range of interpretation. 
With the use of figure 2, Drucker displays exactly how comparing data sets can contain more forms of information visualization.

(Drucker, J. Fig. 2. 2011)
 This form of data set creates a space for wider interpretation of data being displayed in a graph and leads to new ways of comparing statistics. This form of analysis can be further explored with the use of Voyant Tools.
A Voyant Tools graph displays linkages of related terms and data and provide a cross-disciplinary approach to displaying information. This form of graph can lead to further exploration as there is more than just both an A and B dataset that is displayed. As seen in the graph inserted below, through the use of links in a graph, users are able to analyze and gather information as any text is inserted.

Users are then able to interpret the text differently than others as they form links in the graph, which in turn allows for multiple discussions and conclusions to arise as information is compared. The words, lines, line sizes, colour, and essentially connections, allow for further investigation into the topic and allows digital humanists to find new ways to discuss and display ever-evolving opinions and topics.
This method of graphic display can be linked to other articles within the Digital Humanities field as it is widely applicable to many modern facilitations of research. The article A Digital Humanities Approach to Narrative Voice in The Secret Scripture: Proposing a New Research Method aims to build off other texts within Digital Humanities and gathers influence from Moretti’s text as well. This can influence can be found throughout the article, “Responding to these challenges, in a reflexive and iterative process, we developed the encoding scheme to include an activity attribute, which was introduced to record whether the narrator was “doing” (i.e. moving, looking away and so forth)...” (Keating, J. et.al, 2014).  Each article reveals same or similar aspects when it comes to comprehending graphs or any form of data displays and analyzation. Since the articles enlighten the reader that a comparison between two sets of data; dataset A and dataset B, and concludes that whichever format is chosen to display any type of information within a comparison graph, more than two data sets will always be needed in order to formulate a proper conclusion of the given topic. 
In conclusion, these articles help solidify that within Digital Humanities information that is being displayed or reviewed will always need further interpretation. All graphs of time-based phenomena should now be displayed with any type of graph that presents more than two datasets. This will allow the readers to form strong opinions and lead to discussions which would allow for further interpretation into the information that is being displayed. Digital Humanities must stop data representations in a two dataset formats and move further into the digital realm with tools such as GIFs, video files, topic models and many more to allow for a possibly endless amount of interpretations and discussions.
