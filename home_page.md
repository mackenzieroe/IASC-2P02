## Bio: 

As a digital humanist myself, I find discussing new forms of information gathering, analysis and visualisation extremely interesting and fun. As a second year Brock University  IASC (Interactive Arts and Science) student, being able to explore all areas of Digital Humanities allows for a great time in class discussions and to gain a larger insight into the digital world and how it affects us all.
